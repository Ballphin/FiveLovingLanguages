Welcome to the 5 Love Languages Test Project! This project is inspired by the well-known MBTI personality test that has gained popularity in Korea and worldwide. Our goal is to help individuals and couples better understand their own and each other's love languages. By discovering your love languages, you can enhance communication, strengthen your relationship, and deepen your connection with your partner.

Project Overview
The 5 Love Languages is a concept developed by Dr. Gary Chapman. According to his theory, there are five primary ways people express and experience love: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch. This project aims to create a test that determines the love language of an individual, providing insight into how they prefer to give and receive love.

Understanding these love languages is particularly useful for couples, as it allows partners to express affection in a way that's most meaningful to one another. This project began with a personal endeavor to better the communication and understanding within my own relationship and is now extended to help others do the same.
